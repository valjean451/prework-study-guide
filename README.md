  # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description


This prework study guide was built as part of an introduction to several coding foundations that will be necessary to know and use going forward. Primarily I built this because I was asked to (i.e., it has no particular significance outside this tutorial context), but I stuck with the project because the coursework itself was extremely useful in providing an arena to repeat and understand key concepts (for me, understanding how to upload data to GitHub was something I never understood before, and I appreciated the opportunity to practice).

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
